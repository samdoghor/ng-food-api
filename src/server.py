    designed to provide developers with access to a comprehensive
    collection of information about various Nigerian dishes. By utilizing this
    RESTful API, developers can seamlessly integrate data on ingredients,
    nutritional value, and other pertinent details into their food-related
    applications. The API is built using Flask-RESTful, a framework that
    allows for the creation of robust and scalable APIs, and leverages
    PostgreSQL, a popular and reliable open-source relational database
    management system.
    One of the key features of the Nigerian Food API is its extensive
    database of ingredients. It offers a wide range of ingredients commonly
    used in Nigerian cuisine, including vegetables, meats, spices, grains, and
    more. Each ingredient entry contains detailed information such as the name,
    description, nutritional composition, and potential health benefits. This
    wealth of information empowers developers to create applications that
    promote healthier eating habits or assist users in making informed dietary
    choices.""",
